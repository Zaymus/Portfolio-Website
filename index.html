                    I am a computer science student at Durham College and am on the way to completing a program at Ontario Tech University afterwards. I am an avid learner with a strong belief that there is always room for improvement and learning. After taking my first course of web development last year, my passion for the field and both front and back-end development have grown immensely. My main focus as a future full-stack developer is to create aesthetically pleasing front-ends along with developing efficient and effective back-ends with the main drive being pleasing my employer and clients.

However, while I was teaching myself more about HTML I found that there was so much more I had to learn including the different semantic type tags like "article", "section", "nav", etc. Along with learning these new tags, I would have to learn what semantic HTML is and how to put it into practice. Although I still have much to learn about HTML I believe that I am getting a pretty strong grasp of semantic HTML and how important the skeleton of the web page is, especially when it comes to more advanced or in-depth styling.'></input>

Once we were given our first assignment, I could just feel how creative I felt and how much more I wanted to learn so I can start making websites that look visually appealing and something that I can be proud of after the hours of development it took to create. I am a very precise person and that is the same when it comes to design, I want everything to look perfect and clean. I still have lots to learn about CSS but I cant wait to keep learning it, I have learned a lot about responsive design and still am practicing it but next, I want to learn more about pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. For example, I want to understand the "::before" and "::after" pseudo-classes because I have seen how powerful they can be when it comes to styling elements.'></input>

I started teaching myself JavaScript in late July of 2021, and since then I have become comfortable with the language and enjoy using it to enhance my website developments. The best project and example I have that utilizes  JavaScript is this website, it uses a lot of javascript to create interactions for the user. For example, all of the "about me" icons that take the users to my various social platforms utilize JavaScript, the scroll animation that brings the user to the language/projects sections on the top navbar uses JavaScript, and the biggest impact JavaScript has on this webpage is the pop up you are reading from right now, the language icon, title, and this body are all taken from The HTML code with JavaScript and the DOM, all using event triggers and targets. Using this technology grew my passion even more since CSS, being able to efficiently set links using for loops and navigating the DOM to alter HTML elements and CSS styles always makes me excited and happy when I see it all working the way I envisioned.'></input>

Currently, I am learning more advanced uses of PHP like creating sessions and cookies. I have also utilized PHP to prepare SQL queries and executing them when I need to increase the security of my system and to assist in SQL injection attacks.'></input>

I started learning Python around 2018 and have used it as my primary language to teach myself new concepts within computer science like advanced data structures. for example, I have used python to understand the theory behind pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's and A*, linked lists, binary trees, etc. With this understanding and experience in Python, I am very excited to learn how to incorporate it within a back-end environment."></input>
